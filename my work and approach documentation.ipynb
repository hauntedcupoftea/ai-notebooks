This means that certain columns in the data would be unavailable initially, and our approach must not use them for more than the scope of training an AI model or something similar.\n","- Upon some minor research (source: [this blogpost, mostly](https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2021/03/understanding-legal-argument-1-five.html)), it is revealed that the base of all legal arguments is the arguments that certain facts support or deny certain claims. although i do not know if indian law works in the exact same fashion, the blogpost does not seem to be aligned to a specific legal system. \n","  > There are lots of potential legal rules that could apply to a given set of facts. And there are lots of qualifications and exceptions to legal rules. You have to argue for the rules themselves and show why a particular rule (or major premise) should apply to a particular case.\n","- With this in mind, I believe that the arguments of a case can be referred to as weighted events, with their impact on the case ranging from -1 (completely in favour of the respondant/prosecution) to 1 (completely in favour of the plantiff/defedant/petitioner). These arguments can then be further graded based on their relevance to the judgement with the influence of factors such as evidence, facts, or cited cases. I do not know the specific of the AI that would go behind this, but I believe that by introducing a scoring system like this, we could predict what side the judgement is going to lean towards before a case goes to court.\n","- The grading system could also be in the _[-1, 1]_ interval, since a really badly supported argument could potentially sway the judgement in the opposition's favour (eg. a perjury, although those can lead to mistrials too). These scores could then be added up and then the expected leaning position could be calculated. Similar to expected values in a probabalistic calculation but with weights instead. This system can go extremely in depth as well, where arguments that are mutually exclusive and completely oppose each other will have their scores inversely related to each other. The overall score of the case then will decide who the arguments and facts currently favour.\n","- The drawbacks I can think of for this approach would be: \n","  - It could be difficult to pinpoint points of failure in a legal case, so this approach provides improper legal advice.\n","  - It would be difficult to generate proper decision text as in the sample, unless a good deal of depth into the working of the AI is established (what fact supports/denies what arguments is known, and how similar the cited case was).\n","  - The training data provided is relatively less, and could result in overfitting of some kind.\n","  - Some arguments may evolve over the course of a trial, their impact on the overall judgement varing greatly as a result. I do not know if there is a need to account for changing information, but it would require running the entire process from the beginning every time. This can get tedious\n"," \n","I will now demonstrate something to the effect of my approach, but with completely random numbers. I will take a random case, split out all the arguments, and then grade, score and add them to provide a working example of the approach I have in mind. However, no AI will be involved in this, and the generated numbers will all be random. Also, no involvement of the facts or the citiations will be required here, which should obviously be paramount in the actual application."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"dXZ7BM5ojuO2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1662239288789,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":414,"user":{"displayName":"Anand Chauhan","userId":"12250269168455404130"}},"outputId":"24e9f21e-5d6f-4249-ac4e-e9c541c55983"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([\"13. Written submissions on behalf of the Appellants given by Mr. Andhyarujina also need to be noted. The relevant portion reads as follows: According to the scheme of the BR Act, for the grant of a license to the Appellant, it has to first come within the meaning of a 'cooperative bank' i.e. either a state cooperative bank, central cooperative bank or a primary cooperative bank. It is only after a notification under section 2(u) of NABARD is issued the cooperative society becomes a cooperative bank within the meaning of section 5(cci) of the BR Act as amended by section 56(c) of the BR Act and thus became eligible to for license from the RBI under section 22 of the BR act read with section 56(o) of the BR Act. Thus a notification under section 2(u) in these circumstances necessarily precedes the grant of a license by the RBI. 29. It must be mentioned that it was submitted by Mr. Andhyarujina that a co-operative society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, 1912 can operative in more than one State. It was submitted that this showed that laws dealing with co-operative societies, which operate in more than one State, were meant to be covered.37. It was submitted that the activities of accepting entrance fees and share subscriptions was sufficient to show that the Appellants was carrying on business. 38. Faced with this situation it was submitted that the words 'carrying on business' did not mean that business must be actively carried on. It was submitted that an intention to carry on business would be sufficient and can be taken into consideration for purposes of a declaration under Section 2(u) of NABARD Act. In support of this reliance was placed on the case in Re. Sarflax Ltd. reported in (1979) 1 Ch. D. 592 (at pages 598-599) and the case of Vanguard Fire and General Insurance Co. Ltd., Madras vs. Ms. Frazer and Ross and Anr.40. Faced with this situation Mr. Anandhyarujina submitted that, in the High Court, the Respondent did not challenge the fact that the Appellant was carrying on business of financing other co-operative societies, but only focused on its not carrying on 'banking business'. He submitted that banking business has a specific meaning as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. He submitted that in the Writ Petition it was ambiguously stated in paragraph 4 as follows: The Petitioners further say that, in any event under clause (u) of Section 2 of the NABARD Act, the State Government could not have identified or designated Respondent no.5 as a State Co-operative Bank, firstly because Respondent No.5 is not registered under the State Act, secondly, because Respondent no.5 is registered under the Central Act, thirdly, because the area of operation of Respondent no.5 also extends to the State of Goa and, fourthly, because Respondent 5 is not carrying of any business or banking business. Respondent no.5 has been constituted to carry on banking business. Respondent no.5 cannot carry on banking business unless license is issued by the Reserve Bank of India under the BR Act 1949. Therefore, the State Government could not have designated Respondent no.5 as a State co-operative bank under clause (u) of section 2 of the NABARD Act. Therefore, the order of the State Government dated 30-12-1995 is null and void and is liable to be quashed and set aside.  (emphasis supplied).41. He submitted that there was no specific averment that the Appellant was not carrying on business of financing other co-operative societies. He submitted that no arguments were made by the Respondent before the High Court that the Appellant was not carrying on business of financing other co-operative societies. He submitted that the only argument was fit was not carrying on banking business. He pointed out that the argument as noted by the High Court in the impugned judgment was as follows: Mr Singhvi submitted that as per the definition of  State Cooperative Bank  given in the said section 2(u), such a bank could only be the principal co-operative society in a state, the primary object of which would be the financing of other co-operative societies in the state, and that by the proviso it is in effect provided that the State Government may declare a co-operative society in addition to such principal society but such additional society must be carrying on banking business and that too in the State i.e. State of Maharashtra. According to him, admittedly the 5th Respondent for want of necessary license, was not carrying on any banking business as on the date of the impugned declaration, and that the 5th Respondent being a multi state co-operative society could not be said to be a society carrying on such banking business in the State. 42. He pointed out that the High Court held as follows: The words 'carrying on business  means that the such additional or such principal cooperative society must be carrying on business, the business being naturally that of banking. It is true that nowhere, neither in the first part nor in the proviso, the word 'banking' is even mentioned. In our opinion the underlying or the basic requirement is that the principal cooperative society must be carrying on the business of banking and its primary object must be to finance other cooperative societies in the State. Otherwise how can a society be recognized as the State Cooperative bank when it is not even functioning as such on the date of such recognition as a bank nor has the primary object to finance other cooperative societies in the state? 43. He submitted that there is not a single word and a single finding by the High Court that the Appellant was not carrying on business except in the sense of banking business. He submitted that the reason for this is obvious i.e. there was no argument and no challenge that the Appellant was carrying on business other than banking business. He submitted that it is not open to the Respondent to argue something that was not argued before the High Court and which is not investigated and found as fact by the High Court.49. It was submitted by Mr. Andhyarujina that the Appellants have in the meantime collected large deposits and carried on extensive business in the State of Maharashtra. It was submitted that the Appellant was willing to restrict its business to the State of Maharashtra. It was submitted that at this stage this Court should not strike down the Notification or the grant of license. \",\n","       \"In this behalf of the relevant portions of the written submissions given by the learned Attorney General read as follows: 10. It is submitted that a perusal of the BR Act and the NABARD Act would reveal the following scheme:i) for the Appellant to carry on banking business, Reserve Bank of India (hereinafter referred to as RBI) has to grant a license ii) In order to get an RBI license, according to BR Act, the Appellant has to be a co-operative bank i.e. in this case a State Co-operative Bank iii) For the Appellant to be a State Co-operative Bank, it has to be notified as such under Section 2(u) of the NABARD Act  35. On behalf of the Respondents, it was submitted that looking to the nature and purpose of the Act and the fact that the ultimate purpose was to accept deposits from other co-operative societies, it was necessary that the business which is carried on should be banking business. It was also submitted that in any even the business must be financing other Co-operative Societies in the State. It was submitted that the society must be carrying on business in presenti. It was submitted that looking to the nature and purpose of the Act a new society which intended to carry on, in future, the business of financing other co-operative societies or which had merely accepted entrance fee and share subscription from its members could not be declared as a state-operative bank. It was submitted that Appellants had not carried on any business and in any event had not carried on banking business or business of financing other co-operative societies.14. On behalf of the RBI it is however submitted that RBI is competent to license a co-operative bank under the Multi State Act. It is submitted that Section 2 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 lays down that, 'the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not, save as hereinafter expressly provided, in derogation of any, other law for the time being in force . It is submitted that the phrase 'any other law for the time being in force , would cover subsequent legislation. In support of this reliance is placed on the case of Sir Dinshaw Manekji Petit vs. G.B. Badkas reported in AIR 1969 Bombay 151 (paragraph 8). It is submitted that Section 2(b) of the Multi State Act lays down that the Act shall apply to all multi state co-operative societies and Section 3(e) defines co-operative bank to mean a multi state co-operative society which undertakes banking business. It is submitted that Section 3(g) defines co-operative society, and section 3(k) defines multi-state c-operative society to mean a society registered or deemed to be registered under that Act. It is submitted that the word 'undertakes' means making an attempt. In support of this reliance is placed on : (a) Words and Phrases Permanent Edition Volume 43 page 198 and 206  (b) The Law Lexicon by P Ramanatha Aiyar, page 1931  and (c) Black's Law Dictionary, page 1526. It is pointed out that Section 110 of the Multi State Act repeals the Multi Unit Co-operative Societies Act, 1942. On this basis it is submitted that multi state co-operative which is a co-operative bank under the Multi State Act is subject to the licencing power of the RBI.15. It is further submitted that this position becomes clear when one notes that Section 15 of the Multi State Act provides that the RBI can require the central registrar to order moratorium, amalgamation and reorganization of a co-operative bank under the Multi State Act and Section 78 of the Multi State Act empowers the RBI to require the Central Registrar to wind up a co-operative bank if circumstances mentioned in Section 13 D of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, 1961 exist. Reference is also made to Section 13 D of the Deposit Insurance Act which provides for circumstances in which winding up can be ordered. It is submitted that a conjoint reading of Section 13D read with 2(gg) of the Deposit Insurance Act indicates that RBI can exercise power in respect of matters mentioned therein. It is pointed out that Section 48(7) of the Multi State Act, empowers RBI to supersede a co-operative bank. It is submitted that all the above mentioned provisions show that RBI has got the power, to regulate the functioning of a co-operative bank, supersede, order moratorium, amalgamation or winding up, as the case may be. We are unable to accept this submission. The power to regulate, supersede, order, moratorium amalgamation or winding are exercisable only be in respect of a co-operative bank. Such power cannot be exercised in respect of any co-operative society which is not a co-operative bank. Far from supporting the case now sought to be made out, this shows that it is only a co-operative bank which can be licensed and then controlled by RBI.16. It is next submitted that Section 22(1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, lays down that 'save as hereinafter provided, no co-operative society carry on banking business in India unless it is a co-operative bank and holds a license issued in that behalf by the Reserve Bank subject to such conditions, if any, as the Reserve Bank may deem fit to impose. It is submitted that sub-section 2 of the Section 22 lays down the requirement of obtaining of license by various co-operative societies. It is submitted that the last category was relevant. Reliance was placed on the portion which reads as follows: ... any every co-operative society other than primary credit society shall before commencing banking business in India, apply in writing to the RBI for a licence under this Section .It is submitted that this makes it clear that whereas under sub-section 1 of Section 22 every co-operative society which is a co-operative bank cannot carry on banking business without a license  under sub-section 2 of Section 22 every co-operative society other than a primary credit society has to obtain a license before commencing banking business in India. It is submitted that a winder meaning should be given to the word 'co-operative bank' to include other co-operative banks (including one which is registered under the Multi State Act) so that no co-operative society (including a co-operative society under the Multi State Act) can commence banking business without a license. It is submitted that this would be in consonance with the principle of purposive interpretation and harmonious construction of statutes. It is submitted that although Section 5(cci) defines a co-operative bank to mean a state co-operative bank, a central co-operative bank and a primary co-operative bank in view of the scheme of the Multi State Act read with Section 22(1) &amp  (2) of the BR Act, the phrase 'co-operative bank' has to be construed in a broad sense especially in view of the fact that Section 5 starts with the following words  in this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in this subject or context . It is submitted that in the object and context of contemporaneous legislation viz. Multi State Act, 1984, the term 'co-operative bank' must be held to include a bank registered under the Multi State Act. It is submitted that if the RBI did not have such power, the consequence would be, that a Co-operative Bank under the Multi State Act would not require a license for conducting banking business. It is submitted that such an interpretation should be eschewed. It is submitted that a purposive interpretation of Banking Regulation Act and Multi State Act must be given. It is submitted that a contrary interpretation would render, the Multi State Act, so far as it relates to Co-operative Banks redundant.\"],\n","      dtype=object)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":47}],"source":["# first, we select a random case and make a numpy array out of its arguments.\n","case_no = int(np.random.randint(0, 30, 1))\n","dirtyargs = np.array(megadoc.loc[case_no, ['ArgumentsOfPetitioner', 'ArgumentsOfResponder']])\n","dirtyargs"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"KfKKIrmdjuO3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1662239293866,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":778,"user":{"displayName":"Anand Chauhan","userId":"12250269168455404130"}},"outputId":"bc9759c8-8744-4222-f41e-72f6dd84de67"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([\"Written submissions on behalf of the Appellants given by Mr. Andhyarujina also need to be noted. The relevant portion reads as follows: According to the scheme of the BR Act, for the grant of a license to the Appellant, it has to first come within the meaning of a 'cooperative bank' i.e. either a state cooperative bank, central cooperative bank or a primary cooperative bank. It is only after a notification under section 2(u) of NABARD is issued the cooperative society becomes a cooperative bank within the meaning of section 5(cci) of the BR Act as amended by section 56(c) of the BR Act and thus became eligible to for license from the RBI under section 22 of the BR act read with section 56(o) of the BR Act. Thus a notification under section 2(u) in these circumstances necessarily precedes the grant of a license by the RBI. \",\n","       'It must be mentioned that it was submitted by Mr. Andhyarujina that a co-operative society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, 1912 can operative in more than one State. It was submitted that this showed that laws dealing with co-operative societies, which operate in more than one State, were meant to be covered.',\n","       'It was submitted that the activities of accepting entrance fees and share subscriptions was sufficient to show that the Appellants was carrying on business. ',\n","       \"Faced with this situation it was submitted that the words 'carrying on business' did not mean that business must be actively carried on. It was submitted that an intention to carry on business would be sufficient and can be taken into consideration for purposes of a declaration under Section 2(u) of NABARD Act. In support of this reliance was placed on the case in Re. Sarflax Ltd. reported in (1979) 1 Ch. D. 592 (at pages 598-599) and the case of Vanguard Fire and General Insurance Co. Ltd., Madras vs. Ms. Frazer and Ross and Anr.\",\n","       \"Faced with this situation Mr. Anandhyarujina submitted that, in the High Court, the Respondent did not challenge the fact that the Appellant was carrying on business of financing other co-operative societies, but only focused on its not carrying on 'banking business'. He submitted that banking business has a specific meaning as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 19\",\n","       'He submitted that in the Writ Petition it was ambiguously stated in paragraph 4 as follows: The Petitioners further say that, in any event under clause (u) of Section 2 of the NABARD Act, the State Government could not have identified or designated Respondent no.5 as a State Co-operative Bank, firstly because Respondent No.5 is not registered under the State Act, secondly, because Respondent no.5 is registered under the Central Act, thirdly, because the area of operation of Respondent no.5 also extends to the State of Goa and, fourthly, because Respondent 5 is not carrying of any business or banking business. Respondent no.5 has been constituted to carry on banking business. Respondent no.5 cannot carry on banking business unless license is issued by the Reserve Bank of India under the BR Act 19',\n","       'Therefore, the State Government could not have designated Respondent no.5 as a State co-operative bank under clause (u) of section 2 of the NABARD Act. Therefore, the order of the State Government dated 30-12-1995 is null and void and is liable to be quashed and set aside.  (emphasis supplied).',\n","       'He submitted that there was no specific averment that the Appellant was not carrying on business of financing other co-operative societies. He submitted that no arguments were made by the Respondent before the High Court that the Appellant was not carrying on business of financing other co-operative societies. He submitted that the only argument was fit was not carrying on banking business. He pointed out that the argument as noted by the High Court in the impugned judgment was as follows: Mr Singhvi submitted that as per the definition of  State Cooperative Bank  given in the said section 2(u), such a bank could only be the principal co-operative society in a state, the primary object of which would be the financing of other co-operative societies in the state, and that by the proviso it is in effect provided that the State Government may declare a co-operative society in addition to such principal society but such additional society must be carrying on banking business and that too in the State i.e. State of Maharashtra. According to him, admittedly the 5th Respondent for want of necessary license, was not carrying on any banking business as on the date of the impugned declaration, and that the 5th Respondent being a multi state co-operative society could not be said to be a society carrying on such banking business in the State. ',\n","       \"He pointed out that the High Court held as follows: The words 'carrying on business  means that the such additional or such principal cooperative society must be carrying on business, the business being naturally that of banking. It is true that nowhere, neither in the first part nor in the proviso, the word 'banking' is even mentioned. In our opinion the underlying or the basic requirement is that the principal cooperative society must be carrying on the business of banking and its primary object must be to finance other cooperative societies in the State. Otherwise how can a society be recognized as the State Cooperative bank when it is not even functioning as such on the date of such recognition as a bank nor has the primary object to finance other cooperative societies in the state? \",\n","       'He submitted that there is not a single word and a single finding by the High Court that the Appellant was not carrying on business except in the sense of banking business. He submitted that the reason for this is obvious i.e. there was no argument and no challenge that the Appellant was carrying on business other than banking business. He submitted that it is not open to the Respondent to argue something that was not argued before the High Court and which is not investigated and found as fact by the High Court.',\n","       'It was submitted by Mr. Andhyarujina that the Appellants have in the meantime collected large deposits and carried on extensive business in the State of Maharashtra.

It was also submitted that in any even the business must be financing other Co-operative Societies in the State. It was submitted that the society must be carrying on business in presenti. It was submitted that looking to the nature and purpose of the Act a new society which intended to carry on, in future, the business of financing other co-operative societies or which had merely accepted entrance fee and share subscription from its members could not be declared as a state-operative bank. It was submitted that Appellants had not carried on any business and in any event had not carried on banking business or business of financing other co-operative societies.',\n","       \"On behalf of the RBI it is however submitted that RBI is competent to license a co-operative bank under the Multi State Act. It is submitted that Section 2 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 lays down that, 'the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not, save as hereinafter expressly provided, in derogation of any, other law for the time being in force . It is submitted that the phrase 'any other law for the time being in force , would cover subsequent legislation. In support of this reliance is placed on the case of Sir Dinshaw Manekji Petit vs. G.B. Badkas reported in AIR 1969 Bombay 151 (paragraph 8).

It is submitted that Section 3(g) defines co-operative society, and section 3(k) defines multi-state c-operative society to mean a society registered or deemed to be registered under that Act.
